    My second android app wrote in c# with use Xamarin.Forms.
The application allows you to add songs and create songs playlist. You can get text from tekstowo.pl to current songs (searching by title or artist name or both). 
From playlist view you can run presentation of songs text by order in playlist. Text size is set to 20, but number of lines is calculated for device. 
You can use one devices as server to set text presentation and changing pages and other devices in band can connect to server (server client socket solution) 
and text will automaticaly send to clients. Any clients will see the same text in the same time like server device.

The main window of this application is the list of added songs. From there, you can select songs and add them to your new playlist. In addition, when you click on a song, 
you can edit the song along with the ability to delete the song or change information such as artist, title or lyrics (looks exactly like add song window) and see which playlist 
it is added to.

  From this window possible is looking for song text by only artist, only title or both. Text come from output html code from tekstowo.pl. To this solution I use HTMLAgilityPack.

  From connection settings window you can start server (IP is getting from connected network, so you can also run hotspot, 
  connect other devices to server devices and this will be work) on custom port (default is 11000). After start server this window inform about count of connected client. 
  From client page of this window you can write IP and port and connect to server. After connect from this page you can run presentation mode to getting text from server device.

  List of playlist show all created playlist. After click are show detail information about playlist with list of song. From there you can edit name, add or remove
  songs, change order of current song or start text presentation. Edit options show after click on edit button. When text presentation start, if current device is server, 
  automaticly start sending songs text to clients devices.
